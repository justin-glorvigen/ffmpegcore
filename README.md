# ffmpegcore
.NET Core Utility for leveraging the ffmpeg executable for windows (Would probably work for other OS's supported by .NET Core with a little tweaking)

Uses a compiled ffmpeg executable for Windows x64, if you are on a 32-bit version just download it (<a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html" target="_blank">link</a>) and replace it in the App_Data folder of the utility.
